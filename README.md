# Project A.I.

The purpose of this project is to create an autonomous self-driving robot, which is able to follow a course and avoid obstacles, all on its own. 
Its inspiration originates from being a big fan of Elon Musk, Tesla and its technology. 
This project is mainly created for PWS (profielwerkstuk) using our own specific hardware, but it can be replicated by the user to work on their hardware as well.

## Features

- Fully autonomous driving without any input from the user
- Ability to manually control using a PS4 - PS5 controller
- Ability to manually control using the website created on the local WiFi
- Displaying a 2D model of the surroundings on the website 
- Making use of the well-proven machine learning library [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
- Source code written in both Python and C++ (currently under development)
- Using threads and thread pooling for every core functionality
- Integrating modules to maintain the code better
- Using the latest Raspberry Pi 4B+ for faster operations

## Notes

- Every core functionality of the robot is assigned to a separate thread, all managed in a thread pool. This makes the robot able to:
    - Run the artificial intelligence continuously
    - Automatically connect to a console controller, once available
    - Continuously run the webserver, without interfering with the core functionality
    - Scan the environment with the YDLidar sensor, create a 2D model

## Dependencies
The python code uses different modules to add additional functionalities. These are listed below and can be installed using their respective commands.

[YDLidar SDK](https://github.com/YDLIDAR/YDLidar-SDK) to drive the YDLidar sensor:
```
git clone https://github.com/YDLIDAR/YDLidar-SDK.git
cd YDLidar-SDK
pip install .
```

[RPi GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO) to manage and setup the pins on the Raspberry PI:
```
pip install RPi.GPIO
```

[netifaces](https://pypi.org/project/netifaces/) to provide network access
```
pip install netifaces
```

[pyPS4Controller](https://pypi.org/project/pyPS4Controller) to connect and control a PS4 - PS5 controller
```
pip install pyPS4Controller
```
